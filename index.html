                <li><a href="https://github.com/helllopratik/emotion_chat_with_chatgpt">Project: EmoQuery A human-like Conversation with Gemini AI</a>: A Python based Machine learning project where user can communicate with gemini ai along with the emotions. While sending query to the user your device camera will capture frame and identify the emotion of the user locally at the time of query sending. Based on the emotion that user was while sending query, the ai will react and send response accordingly. The application will let gemini ai know that in response it also has to take user emotion into consideration which allow human-like conversation.</li>
